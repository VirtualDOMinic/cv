# HTML CV (for print/pdf)!

This is just a place for me to host/demonstrate my A4 HTML CV.
It's intended to be printed/saved as pdf, not to be viewed by most users as a web page, so the CSS has very little in the way of fallbacks.

My phone number and email address are populated by a script that I have added to the `gitignore`, so you can only see them if viewing on my laptop (or if you see the PDF version saved from my browser).

If you'd like to get in contact, you can message me on LinkedIn (see CV) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominicdigital).

## Notes

- The single-page version is **very cramped**, so probably isn't for most people. The 2 page version is a WIP
- Design based on a "modular" format of a CV I recently made in MS Word
- I felt that CSS (Grid) and HTML would be better suited for making my CV, so I went ahead and remade it with those tools in this repo!
- I used margins where I could have probably used `grid-gap`
- The primary units used are `cm` and `rem`. Centimetres are used to enforce an A4-sized area for my content so that it can easily be printed/saved as a single A4 PDF.
