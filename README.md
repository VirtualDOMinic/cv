### Note
This CV readme is far from complete, and subject to change significantly until late October 2018.

# Dominic Coelho | GitHub CV
I am a full-stack (JS/ES6, HTML/CSS/SASS, Node, PostgreSQL) JavaScript developer and soon-to-be graduate of [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/). I am keen to learn a lot more, with a focus on creating, and contributing to, efficient, secure, maintainable and scalable applications.

Soon to join the above table: React, Redux, Webpack, Babel, MongoDB...

## What I'd Love To Learn
I am looking to improve my ability as a developer, and to build upon the skills I already have (JS, React, Git, SQL, testing...), but - beyond this - I am especially interested in getting significant experience with one or more of the following in the coming years:
* Elixir/Phoenix: I've heard great things about the scalability, fault-tolerance and developer experience that come with Elixir and Phoenix. Also want to get to grips with a functional language.
* TypeScript/Elm: to see the benefits of a strongly-typed system for myself
* GraphQL: 
* React Native, Flutter or a similar cross-platform mobile development framework.

## Example projects
Small projects will go here. 
See [issue #1](https://github.com/VirtualDOMinic/cv/issues/1)

## Other Interests
I love music. I'm classically-trained (grade 8 Cello and Flute), but most of my time is spent consuming music in the form of Electronic, Jazz or relatively contemporary Classical. You can often find me at [the Barbican](https://www.barbican.org.uk/), e.g. for the EFG London Jazz Festival, Ryuichi Sakamoto/Alva Noto, VRIL or Ryoji Ikeda.

I like/love more than just music, but you'll have to revisit this readme in a while to find out more!
