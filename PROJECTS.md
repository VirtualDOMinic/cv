# Dominic Coelho | Projects
Constantly a WIP. Last updated: November 2018.

## About
This readme is a place for me to highlight certain projects that I've completed (solo or as part of a team). As time goes on the layout will improve. The aim is to provide a central place to list some of my projects, link to their repos, and briefly summarise what they are, what I'm proud of, and what could be improved.

Projects listed in reverse chronological order (most recent -> oldest).

## Projects I'd like to highlight
### "This Works"
A way to connect SMEs with local governments. The site allows SMEs to set up and edit profile pages (involving user registration, file upload, video embedding and more). Future goals are to make this easily searchable for local governments to find the SMEs that can solve/have already solved problems that they want to tackle.
* Repo link: [sleuth-coop](https://github.com/VirtualDOMinic/sleuth-coop) (forked to show state of project after 2 weeks of work)
* Demo may be viewable [here](http://sleuth-sme.herokuapp.com/), but will be affected by subsequent build sprints
* Proud of: 
    * How much my team and I achieved in such a short period (~10 days of build time, with interuptions due to client meetings and other commitments on the course)
    * The fun carousel form that we built for the SME signup flow
    * Getting stuck in with planning, QA, design, react, node and postgreSQL (i.e. not just focusing on one technology/area)
* What could be improved
    * The testing leaves plenty to be desired
    * Several areas to refactor (e.g. the carousel validation logic)
    * The session authentication/route protection logic is purely demonstrative (i.e. not for use in production) - easily bypassed, and relies on user IDs matching company IDs in our database logic
